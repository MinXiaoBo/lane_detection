In recent years, China's economy has developed rapidly, and various domestic vehicles have also increased rapidly.
Of course, the accompanying car accidents are also frequent. 
In order to solve the threat of life and property caused by car accidents, our country and the world are rapidly developing assisted driving and more advanced. 
Unmanned technology, and we have achieved good results so far. 
As an introductory course for driverless or assisted driving technology - lane line detection is also an important research object. 
The main research of this article is the detection of the lane line. 
Of course, our research scene is also limited. 
We are based on the computer vision of the camera to complete the detection of the lane line. 
Not all lane lines can be detected.
We focus on It is the detection of lane lines on expressways or specific areas. Because the roads in our country are complex and varied, it is unrealistic to be able to detect various scenes well, and it is very difficult and currently the most cutting-edge.
Human driving technology is also driving on a specific range of roads. I will first describe how the straight lane line is detected, including the image edge detection technique and the Hough line detection algorithm. 
Then, the lane-line detection technique of the curve is described, and the focus is also on the extraction of the lane line pixels and the fitting algorithm of the curve. 
Of course, there are still many problems that I have not solved here. I need more people and more time to explore. 
Everyone works hard to contribute to China's driverless technology.this is a lane detection project
